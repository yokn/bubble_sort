# frozen_string_literal: true

# Take an array from the user and store it
# Create a new array to store the results
# Until end of the array is reached:
#   Compare the next two chars (with the spaceship operator)
#   If the second char is bigger than the first char:
#     Copy their values to the results array swapped
#   Else copy their values to the results array
#   If the last char is reached:
#     Reduce the array length by one
# Print the results array
